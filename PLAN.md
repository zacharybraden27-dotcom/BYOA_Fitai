## Notes

### Implementation Decisions
- **Mock Data Service**: Implemented MockDataService for testing and development. All services check `AppConfig.useMockData` flag before making network calls. This allows full app functionality testing without backend setup.
- **Backend**: **Currently using mock data. Supabase integration in progress.**
  - Supabase service wrapper created (`SupabaseService.swift`)
  - Database schema SQL created (`supabase/schema.sql`)
  - Setup guide created (`SUPABASE_SETUP.md`)
  - Ready for Supabase project setup and integration
- **Demo Credentials**: `demo@fitai.com` / `demo123` - Pre-populated with sample food entries and goals (mock data)
- **AI Service**: Currently using mock implementation that returns random food items. Ready for real AI service integration (OpenAI GPT-4 Vision, etc.)
- **Architecture**: MVVM pattern with SwiftUI. All ViewModels are marked with `@MainActor` for thread safety.

### Known Issues
- Password reset functionality not yet implemented
- Photo storage service exists but needs full implementation
- Goal setting UI needs to be built (models and services are ready)
- History view is placeholder (needs implementation)
- Multiple food items in single photo not yet supported

### Completed Features
- ✅ Full authentication flow (sign up, sign in, sign out)
- ✅ Session management with UserDefaults
- ✅ Food entry creation (manual and AI photo analysis)
- ✅ Daily tracking dashboard with progress indicators
- ✅ Macro tracking and goal comparison
- ✅ Meal type association (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)
- ✅ Real-time data updates after adding entries
